I've only recently started building websites using markdown and processing through Hugo.  So for a while I was trying out several different themes, trying to find the right fit. I liked  Ananke theme and then tried Docsy, but found Docsy felt like a mess trying to setup.  I finally discovered that simpler is better and have settle on my two favorite themes. Congo and Dimension. Because this site is a mirror with another name they are both using the Congo theme. I then build out pages for that site using ~~Atom~~ VSCodium and then while still in ~~Atom~~ VSCodium, just copy the page over from the other site and change the names to match the author and domains.  I suppose if you were to look at the source code for this site, you would discover the other one. Or you could just look at my git credentials and figure it out as well, or even my personal productivity site since one site serves all. Discover-ability from my other domain to this one is fairly protected, just not from this domain to the other. It's a pretty obvious discovery anyway. My personal site is using the Dimension theme and though it is a very cool theme. It seems that it would not work well for documenting things or rather reading documented things.
