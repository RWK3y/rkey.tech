### Introduction
note: I use Starship so 'bsh âžœ' is just my prompt.

This is the document repository for setup and configuration of domains and servers for [RKey.Tech](/) and <a href="https://titania.opekkt.tech/" target="_blank">Docs.RKey.Tech</a> and all the subdomains and projects as well. Also included will be workstation setup to support the same projects.  Though general Linux/FreeBSD/OpenBSD workstation stuff will be in a different subsection [here](docs/WorkStation/).
