***Note:*** I use Starship so ***bsh âžœ*** is just my prompt. Also this is mostly for my own documentation reference feel free to use as a resource and certainly feel free to suggest corrections once I get commenting and contact me working.<br>
***Also:*** I'm very talkative, so to keep the [docs](/docs/) section from running of the rails on back story, comments and thoughts, you will see some entries have matching [blog](/posts/) entries.
